🚀 Predicting the Future: How We Used AI to Forecast Pharmaceutical Sales! 📈💊

As part of our Data Science and Engineering degree at Carlos III University of Madrid, we collaborated with Sandoz on a machine learning project to optimize pharmaceutical sales forecasting. The goal? To ensure that medicines are produced and distributed efficiently—avoiding shortages and excess stock!

👨‍💻 @Francisco José Landa Ortega
👨‍💻 @Alejo González García

A special thanks to our mentors @David Méndez, @Juan Pérez-Prim, @Carlos Salle, and our professors @Javier Nogales and @Fernando Díaz for guiding us throughout this journey. Their insights and support were invaluable!

🔍 What We Did:
We explored both traditional forecasting models (Exponential Smoothing, Prophet) and advanced machine learning techniques (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest). After rigorous testing on the M5 Kaggle dataset, we applied our refined models to Sandoz’s real-world sales data, achieving high accuracy predictions. We tackled time series analysis, outlier detection, data preprocessing, and created an ensemble model to enhance forecasting precision.

🎯 Results We're Proud Of:
✔️ Developed an ensemble forecasting approach for better accuracy
✔️ Successfully handled outliers and anomalies (like COVID-19 sales spikes)
✔️ Applied machine learning techniques to a real-world pharmaceutical dataset
✔️ Gained valuable experience in AI-driven sales forecasting

We are incredibly proud of what we achieved in this project! 🚀 This experience gave us hands-on exposure to real-world data science challenges and how data and machine learning can transform business decisions.
